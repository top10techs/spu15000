<p><b><u>Camera</u></b>- Most people thought that higher the
mega pixels (mp) of cameras,higher will be the camera quality.
But this is not truth.Mega pixels are only responsible for 
details in the image.It has nothing to do with image quality.
That is why iphones are better in quality even if they have less mega pixels.
To buy a phone with better camera we have to look other things like
camera sensor size(the larger,the better),camera focal length,camera sensor type etc.After 
seeing all these then we have to look for mega pixels i.e the priority of mega pixels is very less for quality
of image.</p>
<p><b><u>RAM</u></b>- Most people think that higher the size of RAM higher 
will be performance.But it is not truth.The performance of phone depends on RAM speed and memory type not on RAM capacity.
RAM capacity helps us only in multi tasking.RAM capacity does not increase the performance of phone
Higher the speed,higher will be the performance</p>
<p><b><u>CPU</u></b>Most peolple think that the performance of the cpu
depends only on its clock speed.But it is not truth.The performance of the cpu mostly depends
on its architecture,no of cores it has,its lithography process etc.The priorty
of clock speed is not much as compared to its architecture.</p>
<p><b>Storage</b>Most people think higher the storage,more better it will be. But 
it is not truth. The speed of phone depends on storage type not on storage capacity.</p>

<p><b>Charging speed</b>Most people think that higher the charging speed the better it is.
But it is not.Because the phone which charges quickly also discharges quickly.Besides more heat is produced
which is not very good for the phone.</p>

<p><b>Battery capacity</b>Most people think that higher the MAh of battery the better it is.
But is not true. The backup of your phone depends on lots of factors. It depends on software.</p>
